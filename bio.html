<b>Mosaic Realism</b>
<br><br>
Fragmentation is as old as Cubism and as contemporary as sampling and sound bytes.
My own mosaic view began as a child, cutting out images and phrases from magazines. 
<br><br>
As I glued the out-of-context fragments onto blank pages, I created new stories from the stash, finding a common theme among the pieces or timing an unexpected twist to be found by the viewer only after the turn of a page.
<br><br>
<b>Deconstruct - Reconstruct</b>
<br><br>
Sitting at the controls of the family stereo, I listened to radio stations, ready to record voice fragments from DJs, newscasters, and other radio personalities. 
<br><br>
With no chance to re-edit the recordings, I carefully anticipated short pieces I could string together, weaving a type of creative non-fiction, looking for a through-line in the random quotes.
<br><br>
<b>Multiple Viewpoints</b>
<br><br>
I <a href="cv.html">pieced together an education</a> in visual and written communication at 5 different schools and 
came to believe in a <a href="http://urbancamp.blogspot.com/2006/05/mosaic-realism.html">mosaic realism</a>. 
<br><br>
The parts of the whole can shift. The <a href="works/lisa_behind_busstop_glass.html">point of focus</a> can change. A <a href="works/on_the_surface.html">buried layer</a> can surface. The <a href="works/unfinished_painting.html">pattern can be altered</a>. Every image is <a href="works/incomplete.html">incomplete</a>. We never get <a href="works/amazon.html">the whole story</a>, ever. 
<br><br>
So, I keep asking, "What is the <a href="works/vision.html">viewing point</a> at the moment? What parts of the whole are currently out-of-focus? What is in the peripheral of the current perspective? What is <a href="works/i_cant_have_it_all2.html">missing</a>?"
<br><br>
<b>Added Layers</b>

<td>When I first started exhibiting, I made big images with small text.
<br><br> 
I wanted to reverse the traditional pattern of having pictures illustrate text. 
<br><br>
I wanted the text to add another layer to, or illustrate, what the viewer saw.

<b>Shuffled Images</b>
<br><br>
Then I started cutting up and shuffling images I drew. As I hung up my first attempt, I noticed that it resembled a <a href="works/woman_fabric.html">woman's face stuck in the squares of a patchwork quilt</a>. 
<br><br>
After reading a 1998 <I>Newsweek</I> article about the women wearing burkas in Afghanistan, I went back to the quilt woman and wrote on her, "woman stuck in the fabric of society."
<br><br>
<b>Pieces of the Whole</b>
<br><br>
To what degree can the parts of everything around us ... <a href="works/white_wedding.html">society</a>, 
<a href="works/guerilla_art.html">culture</a>, <a href="works/nice_piece.html">individuals</a> ... 
be <a href="works/sacred_scared.html">reshuffled</a> like a deck of cards, 
<a href="works/spliced_film.html">edited likes squares of film footage</a>?
<br><br>
Can art represent this ever-present possibility to shift? I've been exploring this question.
