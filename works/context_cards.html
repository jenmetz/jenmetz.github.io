A friend once started a story with a line that jumped out at me:<br><br>
<strong>"I think the thing that kept my parents together
for as long as they were together was their equal love of bad weather."</strong>
<BR><BR>
I loved its uniqueness, that I would probably only hear a sentence like that once.
And it could almost stand on its own as a very very short story.
Although it was short enough to pull out and put on a postcard, I didn't (yet).
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
I started noticing more of these sentences, collecting them, 
expressing my delight to the people who said them. 
<BR><BR>
The concept for the card came at the end of an 
<a href="on_the_surface.html">art festival in Kosovo</a>.
Each card with my contact details that I gave to a new friend included one of the unique sentences I'd heard him or her say during the 10 days we'd spent together.
<BR><BR>
<small>[back]</small>
<BR>
<img src="postcard_back2.jpg" border="1">
<BR><BR>
As each person read their very very short story, a look of recognition came over their face and they smiled.  
They seemed to appreciate the experience as much as I had the first time one of their sentences jumped out at me.
<BR><BR>
It was here that I thought postcards could capture the great vignettes that pop out of conversations.
Sending them back to the speaker, out of context, allows me to reintroduce a line so that the speaker experiences his or her own language in the way that I first heard it.

I entered a second version of the design into <a href="http://www.carted.eu/cartes/aplates/plan224.htm" target="_blank">series 224</a> of
the <a href="http://www.carted.eu/pages/presenta.htm" target="_blank">cARTed
