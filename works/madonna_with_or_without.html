<b>Madonna With or Without Child</b><br>
<small>

oil paint, 2 cotton canvases, linoleum prints<BR>
1 x 2 meters<BR>
1999<BR>
collection Dory and Kees Grandia</small><BR>
<BR>
A woman in the front painting holds a 'poster' of herself holding a baby.
<BR><BR>
Most likely this is because these images evolved when I was really thinking about whether or not I wanted to have children. 
<BR><BR>
After finishing the painting(s), I saw an artist's work entitled, 
"Madonna Without Child." 
<BR><BR>
Immediately I knew this painting was, "Madonna With or Without Child."

People often ask about the process for this painting. 
<BR><BR>
I am attracted to the detailed visual aspects of pattern (love <a href="http://www.expo-klimt.com/">Gustav Klimt</a>) as well as the <a href="http://urbancamp.blogspot.com/2006/05/mosaic-realism.html">metaphorical connotations</a>. 
<BR><BR>
Life is full of pattern: weather patterns, speech patterns, 
behavior patterns, etc.
<BR><BR>
Thinking of DNA, I was seeking to make a 'grouping pattern' that would somehow represent the way cells come together as an embryo grows. 
<BR><BR>
It's only a little glob of cells in the beginning but before long, all of the ear cells are 
grouped together and all of the heart cells stick together, etc. 
<BR><BR>
The pattern in this painting came from a 'blueprint' made from cutting up the marker drawings of eight people into small squares.
<BR><BR>
All of the pieces were grouped by color and glued onto poster board.
<BR><BR>
Photographs of the mother and child were used as references in the painting. 
<BR><BR>
After getting the people down, the pattern was transferred to the canvas square by square 
and then the painting was finished by integrating the people underneath and the pattern above.
