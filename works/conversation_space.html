With each discussion we overlap our lives.
<br><br>
We open up conversation spaces where interpretations 
intermingle and experience is explained.
<br><br>
I am addicted to channel surfing other people's stories because it's eye-opening and entertaining 
in a way that no reality TV show ever could be.

<br><br>
I've been <a href="context_cards.html">grabbing descriptions</a> from 
this landscape and sending them back to the source via postcards.
<br><br>
Now I am curious to see what happens when some of these fantastic fragments, these touchpoints in words, 
are transplanted to that fertile breeding ground for conversation, the dinner table. 
<br><br>
I still use the postcards, but now, when the <a href="context_cards.html">vignettes pop out of conversation</a>, I've also 
started giving them back to the speaker embroidered on a dinner napkin. 
For example: The Hawaiians all have pitbulls.
<br><br>
The speaker of these words gets a set of four. Each of the other three dinner napkins are embroidered with 
a sentence taken from three other people in three completely different conversations. 
<br><br>
The first set launched into the world of table talk comprised all food-related quotes:
<UL>

<LI>It's very difficult to make curry as a tapas.</LI>
<LI>On all the TV cooking programmes everyone always fucks up the risotto.</LI>
<LI>Nothing was spicey in Europe in the late 60s.</LI>
<LI>Especially when Steve is away I have wine and eggs because it's such an adult thing to do.</LI>
</UL>

The second set to be launched:
<UL>
<LI>If the people from the basement are enthusiastic it might just happen.</LI>
<LI>It's inconvenient to go to Asia and come back right now.</LI>
<LI>The Hawaiians all have pitbulls. [see image above]</LI>
<LI>There's the FBI warning against copying fireplaces.</LI>

</UL>

I hope they can sprout interesting conversations! Stay tuned and keep talking!
