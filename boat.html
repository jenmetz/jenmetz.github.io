	ORIGIN OF QUILOMBOS ON THE TROMBETAS RIVER&#042;
	<BR><BR> <B>1780</B> - Cocoa bean cultivation and livestock raising begins near the cities of Santar&#233;m and &#211;bidos. African slave labor used. Quilombo formation seems to have begun in first decades of expansion of cocoa bean cultivation.
	<BR><BR> <B>1812</B> - Disciplinary expedition destroyed the Inferno and Cipotema Quilombos at the source of the Curu&#225; River.
	<BR><BR> <B>1821</B> - A 'Carafuz' (mixture of African and Indeginous) slave by name of Atanasio leads 40 companions to organize a new Quilombo on the banks of Trombetas River with remaining descendents of destroyed Inferno and Cipotema Quilombos = Mocambo Lake. Eventually grows to 2000 members.
	<BR><BR> <B>1822-23</B> - Disciplinary expedition against runaway slaves destroys Trombetas Quilombo and arrests Atanasio. Following years were peaceful. Quilombos maintained commercial relation with inhabitants of Obidos cultivating tobacco and gathering of natural substances. 
	<BR><BR> <B>1827</B> - Trade with the Quilombolas is profitable but increasing numbers of runaway slaves worries plantation owners. So, Santar&#233;m, &#211;bidos and Alenquer mobilized 100+ men who advance up the Trombetas as far as Curu&#225; River and destroy Quilombos there.
	<BR><BR> <B>1835</B> - During the Cabanagem Revolt, slaves sided with the revolutionists, then reorganized and founded a settlement called 'Cidade Maravilha' (Marvelous City). 
	<BR><BR> <B>1852</B> - Hearing of a future disciplinary expedition, Quilombolas abandon 'Marvelous City,' go up river to establish the Quilombo at Campixe.
	<BR><BR> <B>1855</B> - Province Governor Sebastiao do R&#234;go Barros orders expedition against the Quilombos of Trombetas. Quilombolas receive warning and flee up river.
	<BR><BR> <B>1868</B> - New expedition leaves Santar&#233;m with intention of 'dominating the Negroes of the Trombetas;' results were uncertain.
	<BR><BR> <B>1870</B> - On 31 October 1870, Canon Manuel Jos&#233; de Siqueira Mendes, as interim Governor of the then Province of Par&#225;, signed Law No. 653, authorizing the destruction of all Quilombos. Based on this law, new expeditions were organized.
	<BR><BR> <B>1876</B> - Last recorded expedition occurred in the summer of 1876 and was directed against a Quilombo situated on the Curu&#225; River, resulting in its destruction.
	<BR><BR> <B>1888</B> - The expeditions against Quilomos of the Trombetas and Curu&#225; Rivers continued until slavery was abolished on 13 May 1888.

	&#042;This information is taken from an article by L&#250;cia M. M. de Andrade called "The Quilombos of the Trombetas River Basin: Brief History." The paper was conceived to provide information for the work of the Association of Remaining Descendants of Quilombola Communities of the Municipality of Oriximin&#225; (<a href="http://www.quilombo.org.br/html/arqmo.html" target="_blank">ARQMO</a>).
